## 🏗️ Core Architectures
Insights into the building blocks of modern GenAI.

*   [**Transformer Deep Dive**](architectures/transformer-deep-dive.md)  
    *From Attention to MoE.* Understanding self-attention, KV caching, rotary embeddings (RoPE), and Mixture of Experts.
*   [**Agent Architecture Patterns**](architectures/agent-architecture-patterns.md)  
    *Beyond the Chatbot.* Engineering specialized agents via persona scoping, tool restriction, and multi-agent orchestration.

## 🔍 System Design
Blueprints for scaling AI applications to production.

*   [**System Design Interview Blueprint**](system-design/system-design-interview-blueprint.md)  
    A structured framework for tackling ML system design questions—from requirements to optimization.
*   [**Scalable RAG Systems**](system-design/scalable-rag-systems.md)  
    Architecture for enterprise-grade document retrieval: distributed vector DBs, ingestion pipelines, and latency management.

## 🛠️ RAG Pipelines
Practical engineering for accurate and grounded generation.

*   [**RAG Pipeline Deep Dive**](rag-pipelines/rag-pipeline-deep-dive.md)  
    The 10 stages of RAG: Ingestion, Chunking, Embedding, Vector Search, Re-ranking, and Synthesis.
*   [**Evaluation Metrics & Frameworks**](rag-pipelines/evaluation-metrics.md)  
    How to measure what matters: RAGAS (Faithfulness, Relevancy), BERTScore, and handling imbalanced data (PR-AUC).
*   [**Tool Calling Optimization**](rag-pipelines/tool-calling-optimization.md)  
    Making agents reliable: Schema engineering, parallel execution, and MCP integration.

## � Machine Learning Engineering
Applied patterns and coding for the modern ML/AI stack.

*   [**Applied ML Engineering**](machine-learning/applied-ml-engineering.md)  
    Real-world lessons: Handling imbalanced data, metric selection, and production debugging.
*   [**Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Framework**](machine-learning/human-in-the-loop-framework.md)  
    Designing for trust: Confidence routing, manual review queues, and feedback loops for DPO alignment.
*   [**Coding for ML Engineers**](machine-learning/coding-for-ml-engineers.md)  
    High-yield algorithms (Sliding Window, HashMaps) and ML-specific implementations (IoU, Attention).

---

## � Interview Strategy
Preparing for the behavioral and tactical aspects of a Lead role.

*   [**Resume Defense Strategies**](interview-prep/resume-defense-strategies.md)  
    A playbook for quantifying impact, explaining trade-offs, and defending your technical decisions.
